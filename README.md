# Prismic.io Helpers
Helpers for working with https://prismic.io/ and .Net Core

N.B. These packages currently use a [forked version of prismic.io](https://github.com/benembery/csharp-kit) designed to work with .net standard and .net Core. You can either build this yourself or grab a copy from the [packages directory](https://github.com/benembery/prismic-helpers/blob/master/packages/prismicio.2.0.0.nupkg).
